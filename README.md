# üöï BiTaksi RFM Segmentation Project

## 1. Objective
Segment 1 000 customers by Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) scoring, identify key segments, and design data-backed marketing actions.

## 2. Dataset
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Customer ID | Unique rider ID |
| LastTransactionDate | Last trip date |
| Frequency (Usage in Last 12 Months) | Trips in past year |
| Total Spending (TL) | Spend in past year |

## 3. Method
1. **Calculate Recency** (assuming the most recent day as 31-Dec-2024)
2. **Assign R, F, M scores** (quintiles from 1-5)
3. **Create RFM_Score** (`R_Score``F_Score``M_Score`)
4. **Label segments**  
   *Champions, Loyal Big-Spenders, Potential Loyalists, Promising, New Customers, At-Risk*

## 4. Key Findings

![Segments](images/key_findings.png)

| Segment             |       Share of Users | Share of Revenue | Average Spend per Rider (TL) | What it Means                                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------: | ---------------: | ---------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Champions           | **0.6 %** (6 riders) |          **1 %** |                   **4  494** | Very recent, very frequent, highest spend per rider.            |
| Loyal Big-Spenders  |           2.7 % (27) |              4 % |                       3  942 | Nearly as active as Champions; biggest single block to upgrade. |
| Potential Loyalists |         13.4 % (134) |              8 % |                       1  605 | Ride often but spend mid-range ‚Äî strong upsell potential.       |
| Promising           |           1.2 % (12) |            0.6 % |                       1  350 | Early habit forming; need frequency boosts.                     |
| New Customers       |           3.1 % (31) |            1.3 % |                       1  068 | Recently acquired; activation window open.                      |
| At-Risk             |     **49.7 %** (497) |         **55 %** |                       2  854 | Historically valuable but inactive ‚âà 9 months; urgent win-back. |

Totals: 1 000 riders, ‚Ç∫ 2.58 M annual spend.

### Churn-risk segment  
At-Risk users (nearly half of the dataset) haven‚Äôt ridden for approx. 9 months.

## 5. Data-Driven Insights Drawn Directly from the R-, F- and M-Scores

### Data-Driven Insights Drawn Directly from the R-, F- and M-Scores

* **Recency is the clearest churn flag.**
  Riders with **R Score 1-2** (last trip more than \~6 months ago) represent just under **50 % of the base yet over 55 % of revenue**. Their high share of spend combined with long inactivity makes them the most urgent recovery target.

* **Champions vs. Loyal Big-Spenders.**
  Both groups have **R 5** and **F 5**, but Champions also score **M 5**. Loyal Big-Spenders sit at **M 4**; nudging their spend upward by only one quintile would double the size of the top tier without acquiring new users.

* **Emerging customers have recency but lack depth.**
  New, Promising and Potential Loyalist riders all carry an **R Score ‚â• 4**, proving current interest, yet their **M Score ‚â§ 3**. They are prime candidates for ride bundles and milestone challenges to lift spend.

* **At-Risk riders combine low recency with past value.**
  They show **R ‚â§ 3** alongside **F ‚â• 3 or M ‚â• 3**. On average they still spend **‚Ç∫2 850 per year**, far above the overall mean, so every successful win-back delivers disproportionate revenue.

These insights come straight from the Recency, Frequency and Monetary distributions and explain **where churn is happening, where upsell potential lies, and which levers (R, F or M) to pull for each segment.**


## 6. Marketing Recommendations (more on the notebook)
| Segment | Actions |
|---------|---------|
| **Champions / Loyal Big-Spenders** | VIP tier, milestone rewards, beta access |
| **At-Risk** | ‚Ç∫200 ‚ÄúWe Miss You‚Äù credit, win-back email, survey + credit |
| **Emerging (New + Promising + Potential)** | Welcome bonus, ride bundles, referral multipliers, geo-targeted deals (Kadƒ±k√∂y, ƒ∞zmir, etc.) 

## 7. Closing Note

Working through this project turned raw spreadsheets into something far more meaningful‚Äîa clear picture of how people actually use BiTaksi. Along the way I sharpened my data-wrangling skills, learned to translate numbers into stories, and saw firsthand how even simple models like RFM can drive focused strategy. What began as a technical exercise ended as a reminder that good analysis is really about understanding people and meeting them where they are.
