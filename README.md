# üöï BiTaksi RFM Segmentation Project

## 1. Objective
Segment 1 000 customers by Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) scoring, identify key segments, and design data-backed marketing actions.

## 2. Dataset
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Customer ID | Unique rider ID |
| LastTransactionDate | Last trip date |
| Frequency (Usage in Last 12 Months) | Trips in past year |
| Total Spending (TL) | Spend in past year |

## 3. Method
1. **Calculate Recency** (assuming the most recent day as 31-Dec-2024)
2. **Assign R, F, M scores** (quintiles from 1-5)
3. **Create RFM_Score** (`R_Score``F_Score``M_Score`)
4. **Label segments**  
   *Champions, Loyal Big-Spenders, Potential Loyalists, Promising, New Customers, At-Risk*

## 4. Key Findings
